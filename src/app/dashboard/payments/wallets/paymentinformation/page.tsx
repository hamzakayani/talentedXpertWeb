               <p>I can understand why the idea of big data has grown so rapidly. The value of data is very easy to sell. It’s a clear, almost mathematical way to analyse trends and drive marginal gains within a business or product. But equally, I would argue it’s also a lazy strategy if used in silo. What if the fundamental approach the business or a product is taking is wrong? Are you just driving changes towards the wrong end?
               This is where consumer experience or ‘consumer love’ is key. Creating a product that people relate to; that fulfils a real need or desire is critical to building a long-lasting, successful business. But herein lies the problem — how do you measure emotional response towards your product?
